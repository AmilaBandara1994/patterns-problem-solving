/*

    There are family of sorting algorithm that can improve time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n)

    There are tradeoff between efficiency and simplicity 
    
    The more efficient algorithm are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand.


        *   Merge Sort
        *   Quick Sort
        *   Radix Sort
