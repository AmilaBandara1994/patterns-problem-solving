/*
    Heap 

    very similar to binary search tree, but with some different rules 

    in a MaxBinaryHeap parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
    MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes.
    can have at most two children. 

    MaxBinaryHeap

    Each parent has at most two child nodes.
    The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes.
    In a max binary heap the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between sibling nodes.
    A binary Heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.
